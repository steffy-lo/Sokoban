1. Slowly increase the constraints of the game. A stronger heuristic comes from increasing the constraints of the game
on relatively more relaxed constraints that follow weaker heuristics.
2. Specifically for Sokoban, avoiding deadlocks are very important to determining whether a solution will be reached.
Therefore, the alternative heuristics must take into account an infinitely high cost if the state is a "deadlock" and
it is important to find what state determines these deadlocks.
3. Finally, make sure that your heuristic is admissible while incorporating as many factors of the game as possible
into the heuristic such that similar states can be distinguished even by a small margin. In other words, keep
searching for ways to make the heuristic more dominant.
